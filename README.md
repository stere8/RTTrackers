# RTTrackers Project

## Overview
RTTrackers is a dynamic web application designed to provide real-time tracking information across various domains. Currently, the application offers functionalities for tracking stock prices and weather conditions. Built with Flask, it leverages external APIs to fetch and display the latest data to users.

## Current Features
- **Stock Tracking**: Users can select and view real-time stock prices from major exchanges.
- **Weather Tracking**: Provides current weather conditions based on the user's region.

## Upcoming Features
We are excited to announce that the RTTrackers project is set to expand! Here's a sneak peek into what's coming next:

### More Trackers
- **[To Be Announced Trackers]**: We plan to introduce 2-3 additional trackers to our application. These will cover different domains, providing users with a broader range of real-time data.

### Database Integration
- **Persistent Data Storage**: To enhance user experience and application performance, we will integrate a robust database system. This will allow for the storage of user preferences, historical data, and more.

### RESTful API Design
- **API Development**: A RESTful API will be developed to facilitate better data management and to open up our platform for integration with other applications and services.

### Testing
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Ensuring the reliability and stability of our application is paramount. We will implement a suite of tests covering unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.

### And More...
- **Continuous Improvement**: The journey doesn't stop here. We are committed to continuously improving RTTrackers, adding new features, and enhancing existing ones based on user feedback and technological advancements.
